🔥 Live Projects
🧬 Virtual Platform Core
A Twitch-inspired virtual dev arena—real-time chat, voice/video streams, collaborative sandboxed AI tools.
→ Built with SvelteKit + FastAPI + WebRTC + AI agents

🌌 The Metaverse Framework
Open, decentralized worlds. Procedural generation meets real-time multiplayer. NFT-linked customization and AI NPCs.
→ Built in Godot + Unity + Rust-powered backend

👁️‍🗨️ AI Toolkits
On-demand agents: code reviewers, 3D asset generators, exploit proofers, story crafters.
→ Backed by LangChain + Transformers + Midjourney APIs

🔓 Red Team R&D
Experimental malware sandboxes, AI-infused evasion frameworks, swarm botnets with GAN-based obfuscation.
→ Research-only | Closed environment | Cyber defense through offense

🧠 Philosophy: Hack the Known. Build the Unknown.
I don’t just build tools—I architect ecosystems.
I don’t just code—I bend AI, edge tech, and cyber into scalable, real-world applications.
I believe the future belongs to open collaboration, autonomous systems, and resilient virtual communities.

🎥 Daily Twitch Streams
Raw, unfiltered dev sessions.
No posturing. No edits.
Just a builder and the bleeding edge.
